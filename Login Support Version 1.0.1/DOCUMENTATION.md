## 1\. Introduction

This **Tracking Management System** is a lightweight, web-based application designed to help businesses manage and track their product deliveries or service statuses. It allows administrators to create and update tracking entries with unique IDs, while providing customers with a simple interface to track the status of their orders using these IDs. The system aims for simplicity, ease of use, and a professional aesthetic.

-----

## 2\. Features

The system provides the following core functionalities:

  * **Unique Tracking IDs:** Manually add custom tracking IDs (e.g., `BBB236`) for each order.
  * **Detailed Order Information:** Store comprehensive details for each tracking entry, including:
      * Customer Name
      * Customer Address
      * Products (with Quantity)
      * Price
      * Order Date
  * **Status Management:**
      * **Payment Status:** Track payment status (Pending, Paid, Refunded).
      * **Delivery Status:** Track delivery progress (Pending, Processing, Shipped, Out for Delivery, Delivered, Cancelled).
  * **Automatic Updates:** `last_updated` timestamp automatically records the last modification time for an entry.
  * **Admin Panel:** Dedicated interface for adding and updating tracking records.
  * **Customer Tracking Interface:** A public-facing page where customers can enter a tracking ID to view their order status.
  * **Professional Styling:** Clean, modern, and responsive design for a better user experience.

  * **Database:** MySQL / MariaDB
  * **Frontend:**
      * HTML5 (Structure)
      * CSS3 (Styling)
      * JavaScript (Dynamic form elements in Admin Panel)
      * Font Awesome (Icons)
  * **Web Server:** Apache or Nginx

-----

## 4\. System Requirements

To run this project, you will need a local development environment (like XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP) or a web hosting server with the following:

  * **PHP:** Version 7.4 or higher
  * **MySQL/MariaDB:** Database server
  * **Apache/Nginx:** Web server
  * **phpMyAdmin (Optional):** For easy database management

-----

## 5\. Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the Tracking Management System on your local machine or web server.

### Database Setup (MySQL)

1.  **Create Database:**
      * Open your MySQL client (e.g., phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or command line).
      * Create a new database. We'll use `tracking_db` for this example.
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `tracking_db`;
        USE `tracking_db`;
        ```
2.  **Create Table:**
      * Execute the following SQL query to create the `tracking_items` table:
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE `tracking_items` (
            `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            `tracking_id` VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            `customer_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            `customer_address` TEXT NOT NULL,
            `products` TEXT NOT NULL, -- Stores JSON string of products and quantities
            `price` DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
            `order_date` DATE NOT NULL,
            `last_updated` TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            `payment_status` ENUM('Pending', 'Paid', 'Refunded') DEFAULT 'Pending',
            `delivery_status` ENUM('Pending', 'Processing', 'Shipped', 'Out for Delivery', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled') DEFAULT 'Pending'
        );
        ```

### Project Files Setup

1.  **Download/Clone:** Get all project files (PHP files, `style.css`) from the repository.
2.  **Place Files:** Place the entire project folder into your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP, `www` for WAMP). For instance, if your project folder is `tracking_system`, place it in `htdocs/tracking_system/`.

### Configuration

1.  **Database Connection (`db_config.php`):**
      * Open `db_config.php` in your project folder.
      * Update the database credentials to match your MySQL setup.
      * **Security Note:** For local development, `root` with an empty password is common. **Never use an empty password in a production environment.**
        ```php
        <?php
        // db_config.php
        $servername = "localhost";
        $username = "root"; // Your MySQL username
        $password = "";     // Your MySQL password (empty if none set)
        $dbname = "tracking_db"; // The database you created

        // Create connection
        $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

        // Check connection
        if ($conn->connect_error) {
            die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
        }
        $conn->set_charset("utf8mb4"); // Set character set for proper display
        ?>
        ```

-----

## 6\. Usage Guide

### Admin Panel

The admin panel allows you to manage tracking entries. It's assumed you will implement a separate authentication system for secure access to these pages in a production environment.

  * **Access Admin Dashboard (Conceptual):**
      * Navigate to `http://localhost/your_project_folder/admin_dashboard.php` (you would need to create this file based on the example provided previously). This page lists all tracking items and provides actions to edit or delete them.

#### Adding a New Tracking Item

1.  **Access Page:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/your_project_folder/admin_add.php`.
2.  **Fill Form:** Enter all required details:
      * **Tracking ID:** A unique identifier (e.g., `XYZ789`).
      * **Customer Name:** Full name of the customer.
      * **Customer Address:** Full delivery address.
      * **Products & Quantity:**
          * Enter the `Product Name` and `Quantity` for each item.
          * Click **"Add Another Product"** to add more product rows.
          * Click **"Remove"** to delete a product row.
      * **Price:** Total price of the order.
      * **Order Date:** Date the order was placed.
      * **Payment Status:** Select from the dropdown (Pending, Paid, Refunded).
      * **Delivery Status:** Select from the dropdown (Pending, Processing, Shipped, Out for Delivery, Delivered, Cancelled).
3.  **Submit:** Click the **"Add Item"** button to save the new tracking record. A success or error message will be displayed.

#### Updating a Tracking Item

1.  **Access Page:** From your `admin_dashboard.php` (if implemented), click the "Edit" link next to the tracking item you want to update. This will take you to a URL like `http://localhost/your_project_folder/admin_update.php?tracking_id=BBB236`.
2.  **Data Pre-fill:** The form will automatically populate with the existing details of the selected tracking ID, including all products and their quantities.
3.  **Modify Details:** Change any necessary fields (customer name, address, products, price, order date, payment/delivery status).
4.  **Submit:** Click the **"Update Item"** button to save your changes.

#### Admin Dashboard (Conceptual)

While not fully provided in the code, a robust admin dashboard (`admin_dashboard.php`) should:

  * List all `tracking_items` in a table.
  * Provide "Edit" links (e.g., `admin_update.php?tracking_id=XXX`) for each item.
  * Offer "Delete" links (e.g., `admin_delete.php?tracking_id=XXX`) with confirmation.
  * Potentially include search/filter options if the number of entries grows large.

### Customer Tracking Interface

This is the public-facing part of the system.

1.  **Access Page:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/your_project_folder/track.php`.
2.  **Enter Tracking ID:** The customer will see a simple input field. They need to enter their unique tracking ID (provided by the administrator).
3.  **Track Order:** Click the **"Track Order"** button.
4.  **View Details:** The system will display the complete details of the order, including:
      * Tracking ID
      * Customer Name and Address
      * Product List with Quantities
      * Price and Order Date
      * Last Updated Timestamp
      * Current Payment Status (with an icon)
      * Current Delivery Status (with an icon)
      * If no record is found, an appropriate message will be displayed.

## 7\. Database Schema

The system uses a single table, `tracking_items`, in the `tracking_db` database.

**Table: `tracking_items`**

| Column Name      | Data Type                    | Constraints                                   | Description                                       |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`             | `INT`                        | `AUTO_INCREMENT`, `PRIMARY KEY`               | Unique identifier for each tracking record.       |
| `tracking_id`    | `VARCHAR(20)`                | `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`                          | The custom tracking ID (e.g., BBB236). Must be unique. |
| `customer_name`  | `VARCHAR(255)`               | `NOT NULL`                                    | Name of the customer.                             |
| `customer_address` | `TEXT`                     | `NOT NULL`                                    | Full address of the customer.                     |
| `products`       | `TEXT`                       | `NOT NULL`                                    | Stores JSON string like `[{"name":"Product A","qty":2},{"name":"Product B","qty":1}]`. |
| `price`          | `DECIMAL(10, 2)`             | `NOT NULL`                                    | Total price of the order.                         |
| `order_date`     | `DATE`                       | `NOT NULL`                                    | Date when the order was placed.                   |
| `last_updated`   | `TIMESTAMP`                  | `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` | Automatically updates on record modification.     |
| `payment_status` | `ENUM('Pending', 'Paid', 'Refunded')` | `DEFAULT 'Pending'`                   | Current payment status of the order.              |
| `delivery_status`| `ENUM('Pending', 'Processing', 'Shipped', 'Out for Delivery', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled')` | `DEFAULT 'Pending'`           | Current delivery status of the order.             |

## 8\. Code Structure and Files

The project is organized into several PHP and CSS files:

  * **`db_config.php`**: Contains the database connection parameters and establishes the connection to MySQL. This file is included in all other PHP files that interact with the database.
  * **`admin_add.php`**: Provides the form and backend logic for administrators to add new tracking items to the database. Includes JavaScript for dynamic product input fields.
  * **`admin_update.php`**: Provides the form and backend logic for administrators to view and modify existing tracking items. It pre-fills the form with current data and includes JavaScript for dynamic product input fields and data pre-population.
  * **`admin_dashboard.php` (Conceptual)**: (Not fully provided, but recommended) This would be the main administrative interface listing all tracking items and providing links to `admin_add.php` and `admin_update.php`.
  * **`track.php`**: The public-facing page where customers can enter a tracking ID to search for their order.
  * **`view_tracking.php`**: Displays the detailed tracking information to the customer based on the provided `tracking_id`. This page is heavily styled and uses Font Awesome icons.
  * **`style.css`**: Contains all the CSS rules for styling the entire application, ensuring a professional and consistent look across all pages.

-----

## 9\. Security Considerations

**IMPORTANT:** The provided code offers a basic functional system. For production environments, **strong security measures are essential**.

  * **Authentication & Authorization:** The admin pages (`admin_add.php`, `admin_update.php`, `admin_dashboard.php`) currently have no login protection. **You MUST implement a robust user authentication system** (e.g., using PHP sessions, password hashing with `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`) to restrict access to authorized personnel only.
  * **SQL Injection Prevention:** While `mysqli_real_escape_string()` is used, it's generally recommended to use **Prepared Statements with Parameterized Queries (using `mysqli_stmt_bind_param()`)** for all database interactions. This is the most secure way to prevent SQL injection attacks.
  * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Always use `htmlspecialchars()` when echoing user-supplied data to the HTML output. This prevents malicious scripts from being injected into your pages. This has been applied in the provided code snippets.
  * **Error Handling:** In a production environment, disable `display_errors` in `php.ini` and use proper error logging (`error_log`) to prevent sensitive information from being exposed to users.
  * **Input Validation:** Implement server-side validation for all user inputs (e.g., ensuring price is a number, date is a valid date, tracking ID matches expected format) to prevent invalid or malicious data from entering your database.

-----

## 10\. Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for extending the functionality of this system:

  * **Admin Login System:** Implement secure user authentication for the admin panel.
  * **Email Notifications:** Send automated email updates to customers when their delivery status changes.
  * **Search and Filter:** Add search and filtering capabilities to the admin dashboard for easier management of large numbers of tracking items.
  * **Pagination:** Implement pagination for the admin dashboard to handle many records efficiently.
  * **Tracking History/Timeline:** For `view_tracking.php`, instead of just the last updated status, show a timeline of all status changes for a more detailed customer view.
  * **Admin Data Editing:** Allow admins to edit other fields like `customer_name`, `customer_address` directly from the dashboard.
  * **Delete Functionality:** Implement a `admin_delete.php` script to allow admins to remove tracking entries.
  * **More Robust Product Management:** If products become complex (e.g., with SKUs, descriptions), consider a separate `products` table and a `order_items` table (linking `tracking_items` to `products`) for a more normalized database design.
  * **Customization Options:** Allow admins to customize status options or add notes to tracking entries.
  * **API for Integration:** Create a simple API to allow other systems to interact with your tracking data.

-----

## 11\. Troubleshooting

  * **"Connection failed" error:**
      * Check your `db_config.php` credentials (username, password, database name).
      * Ensure your MySQL server is running.
      * Confirm `localhost` is correct or use the appropriate IP/hostname.
  * **PHP errors on page load:**
      * Check your web server's error logs (Apache `error.log`, Nginx `error.log`).
      * Temporarily enable `display_errors = On` in your `php.ini` (for development only) to see errors directly in the browser.
      * Ensure all PHP files are correctly placed and named.
  * **JavaScript not working (Add/Remove Product buttons):**
      * Open your browser's Developer Console (F12, then "Console" tab) and look for JavaScript errors.
      * Verify that the JavaScript code is present within `<script>` tags at the end of `admin_add.php` and `admin_update.php`.
      * Check element IDs (`products_container`, `add_product`) and classes (`product-entry`, `remove-product`) for typos and ensure they match the HTML.
  * **Products not pre-filling in `admin_update.php`:**
      * Check the browser's Developer Console for JavaScript errors.
      * Verify `$tracking_data` is correctly populated with data from the database. You can add `var_dump($tracking_data);` at the top of `admin_update.php` for debugging.
      * Ensure the JSON string stored in the `products` column in your database is valid.
      * Confirm the PHP block that generates the JavaScript for pre-filling is correctly placed within the `<script>` tags in `admin_update.php`.
  * **Icons not showing:**
      * Ensure the Font Awesome CDN link is correctly included in the `<head>` section of `track.php` and `view_tracking.php`.
      * Check for any network issues blocking the loading of Font Awesome files.
  * **Styling issues:**
      * Ensure `style.css` is correctly linked in all HTML files (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`).
      * Use your browser's "Inspect Element" tool to debug CSS rules.
